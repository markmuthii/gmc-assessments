# Write a brief introduction of who you are in this file
I am **Ian Ngesa**, pursuing Software Developer course at Gomycode. I am aiming at being a **full-stack developer** while majoring in **backend**.

During the long run I'd like to create functional apps, both web and mobile so as to help out people while solving problems to already existing issues.
