#Section 1: General Awareness
##Web Development Basics:
###What is web development, and why is it essential in the context of the internet?

Simply web development is the art and process of creating websites, web applications, maintaining them and making them accessible via the internet.
Web development is essential in the context of the internet for several reasons:

    *Global accessibility - This means businesses, organisations, and individuals can reach a vast audience regardless of geographical location.
    *Information Sharing and Communication - Web development facilitates the creation of websites and web applications that enable individuals and organisations to disseminate information, communicate with others, and collaborate on various projects.
    *E-commerce and Online Transactions - Websites and web applications provide platforms for conducting secure online transactions, managing inventory, processing payments, and providing customer support.
    *Career Opportunities - With web development as the backbone of the digital world, the demand for web developers remains consistently high. As the tech landscape continues to evolve, so will the skills and job opportunities in the field of web development. 

##HTML Knowledge:
###Have you heard of HTML? If yes, what does HTML stand for, and what is its primary purpose in web development?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. If we can compare a website to a human body, the HTML would be the skeleton.
Just like the skeleton, HTML gives the website:

    *Framework for Structure - It defines the basic structure and layout of content on a webpage.
    *Supports and Organises Content - supports and organises the content of a webpage. It provides the structure that holds together text, images, videos, forms, and other media elements.
    *Connects and Interacts - just as the skeleton allows for movement and interaction within the body, HTML enables interaction and navigation within a webpage.


#Section 2: Familiarity with CSS
##CSS Understanding:
###Are you familiar with CSS? If yes, briefly explain what CSS is used for in web development.

Yes, I'm familiar with CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's used in web development to style the  elements. The “cascading” part of its name refers to how styles are inherited and applied to different elements on a web page based on their relationship to each other in the HTML document. Styles can be applied to a parent element, which will be passed down to its child elements.


#Section 3: JavaScript and Its Importance
##Introduction to JavaScript:
###Have you heard of JavaScript? If yes, what is JavaScript, and why is it crucial for building interactive websites?

Yes, I'm quite familiar with JavaScript. JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development for creating interactive and dynamic features on websites. Unlike HTML and CSS, which primarily handle the structure and presentation of web pages, JavaScript adds functionality and behavior to web pages. This allows for real-time interactions and updates without needing to reload the entire web page. e.g We can use a  click event on an HTML button to  detect when the button is clicked and then run a particular code that updates the button color.


#Section 4: Introduction to React and Node.js
##React and Node.js Awareness:
###Are you familiar with React and Node.js? If yes, provide a brief description of what React and Node.js are commonly used for in web development.

ReactJS and NodeJS are both JavaScript technologies. But the uses of NodeJS and ReactJS are entirely different. NodeJS is a framework of JavaScript which is mainly used for working with the backend of our application or building the backend using JavaScript, whereas ReactJS is a JavaScript front-end library. It is mainly used for building the user interface or the frontend of our application.


#Section 5: Bonus Question
##Learning Intentions:
###Why do you want to learn web development, and what do you hope to achieve by acquiring skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js?

There are many reasons I want to learn web development. First Learning web development opens up a wide range of career opportunities in the tech industry. From front-end development to full-stack engineering, there is a demand for skilled web developers across various sectors. Second reason is with web development skills I'm  empowered to start my own businesses. Where I can create websites or web-based products and services, potentially generating income and fulfilling entrepreneurial aspirations.

By acquiring skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js I will be able to achieve:
    *Create static or dynamic websites from scratch using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
    *With JavaScript and React, I will build interactive and responsive user interfaces for web applications, enhancing the user experience.
    *With Node.js, I will  build server-side applications and APIs, enabling me to develop full-stack web applications that handle both front-end and back-end logic.
